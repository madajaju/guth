    summary: In this episode, part one of two, Darren and Intel Cloud Solution Architects Dave Shrestha and Kevin Bleckman talk about the importance of a cloud broker organization. Dave and Kevin founded Intel’s cloud brokerage team about seven years ago.

To rein in the chaos, they created a cloud broker organization.
